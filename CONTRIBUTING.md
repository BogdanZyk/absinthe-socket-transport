# Contribution Guidelines

Hello there. Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Having been started by someone without much experience in the Swift language, this project can really benefit from your assistance.

Reading and following the guidelines in this document is an act of kindness and respect for other contributors. With your help, we can address issues, make changes, and work together efficiently.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project:

* Of course, those with experience in Swift can help us to address observed and potential issues.
* Those with knowledge of Absinthe and Phoenix can help us to effectively use the transport.
* Users of the package can help to test new use cases and installation methods. Documentation improves everyone's experience.
* Anyone can assist in triaging bugs, identifying root causes, and proposing solutions.

Please keep in mind the intended scope of this package: to provide a Phoenix Channel-based transport for the Apollo iOS library that is compatible with Absinthe. Features that aim to, for example, provide full support for GraphQL in Swift, might belong in a different project.

## Ground Rules

All contributions to this project must align with the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Beyond that, we ask:

* Please be kind. Maintaining this project is not paid work.
* Please create an issue before embarking on major refactors or new features.
* Let's make reasonable effort to support as many versions of the various platforms and libraries as possible.
